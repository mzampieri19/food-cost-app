### Food Cost Calculator

### Work in Progress

- This app was designed to help the menager at the restaurant I used to work at, it makes calculating the food cost for particular dishes easier. The app contains the following features. 

1. Add Ingredients: add ingredient details, such as name, amount, unit and cost to create a running list of ingredients that can be used to create dishes.
   
2. Add Dishes: create dishes from the list of ingredients, choose how much of each ingredient goes in each dish and the app will calculate how much is spent on each ingredient with the given proportions, app will also calculate the total cost to make the dish and profit made.  

4. Search: search for ingredients and dishes based on the name, can then choose to select to edit details or delete the selected item. 

5. List: list all ingredients and dishes showing all the details, can also select to view a picture and short description

6. Report: view a small report including total profit, most profitable items, and most used ingredients. 

- Using third party software Render to upload the code to a server to be used in the future, hopefully the free version does the minimum required work. 

-------------------------------------

- Things I will woek on 

1. Allow fields to be defaulted to 0 when nothing is inserted that way profit can still be calculated and not be Nan

2. Fix image rendering and they are not appearing link is being saved which is good. 

3. Change button design in ingredient and dish form to make it more straghtfoward and also add cancel button 

4. Add counter of ingredients and dishes that way they can see that something is being changed,
